Description: Sound Input & Output Device Chooser extension for GNOME Shell
 Shows a list of sound output and input devices (similar to gnome sound 
 settings) in the status menu below the volume slider. Various active ports
 like HDMI, Speakers etc. of the same device are also displayed for selection.
 V20+ needs python as dependency. If you want to continue with the old method 
 without Python, use options to switch off New Port identification. But it 
 works with only English
 .
 This package provides the gnome-shell extension.
 .
 Please note that the extension must be manually enabled, for example
 using gnome-tweak-tool.
